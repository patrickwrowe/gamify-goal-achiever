                    Gamify is a web application that helps you achieve your goals by breaking them down into smaller tasks. 
                    This is done by using the logic from quests in games. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By breaking down your goals into smaller tasks, you can see your progress and stay motivated to achieve your goals. 
                    Each small task you complete gives you a sense of accomplishment and brings you one step closer to your ultimate goal. 
                    This approach not only makes large goals more manageable but also helps you maintain a steady pace and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
